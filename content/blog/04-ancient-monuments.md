The Mendip Hills and surrounding Somerset countryside are positively littered with ancient monuments, stone circles, and mysterious arrangements of rocks that we're assured required tremendous sophistication to construct. Priddy Nine Barrows, the Stanton Drew stone circles, and various lonely menhirs scattered across farmers' fields all demand our reverence for the engineering prowess of our prehistoric ancestors. Having now visited several of these sites, camera in hand and guidebook at the ready, I feel compelled to offer a somewhat controversial observation: these are, when you really examine them objectively, just rocks standing upright. Quite large rocks, certainly, but rocks nonetheless.

Consider the basic premise that has sustained countless documentaries and academic careers: ancient peoples, lacking wheels, cranes, or apparently anything better to do, devoted enormous effort to dragging massive stones across considerable distances and standing them on end in circular patterns. We are told this required astronomical knowledge, advanced mathematics, and sophisticated social organisation. And yet, one cannot help but notice that the finished product looks remarkably similar to what might result from giving a group of reasonably motivated individuals some logs for rolling, a few weeks of free time, and absolutely no access to Netflix. The stones at Stanton Drew don't even form a particularly accurate circle — several appear to have wandered off-centre as if the ancient surveyors got distracted partway through.

The druidical associations attached to these monuments add another layer of delightful absurdity. Despite historians repeatedly pointing out that druids appeared several thousand years after the stone circles were built, popular imagination insists on connecting the two. One can only imagine the actual Bronze Age builders looking down from whatever afterlife they occupy, baffled that credit for their weekend project has been assigned to an entirely different civilisation. "We just wanted somewhere to hold the summer barbecue," they might protest, "and now people think it's a cosmic calendar aligned with the solstices." To be fair, if you put enough stones in a field, some of them will inevitably line up with something astronomical — that's just statistics.

None of this diminishes the genuine historical interest of these sites, of course. They offer tangible connections to lives lived four thousand years ago, and there's something undeniably atmospheric about standing among ancient stones as the Mendip mist rolls in. But perhaps we might dial back the mystical reverence just slightly. The true achievement of Neolithic Britain wasn't the technical complexity of stone-circle construction — it was convincing countless subsequent generations that standing some rocks upright constituted one of humanity's great engineering accomplishments. Now *that* is an impressive feat of public relations, one that continues to fill car parks and gift shops to this very day. The ancient marketing department, whoever they were, deserve our genuine admiration.
