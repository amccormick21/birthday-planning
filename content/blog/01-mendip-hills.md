The Mendip Hills, a 198 square-kilometer stretch of Outstanding Natural Beauty in North Somerset, sits between the cathedral city of Wells, the historic Bristol Channel, and the larger and more sprawling Cotswold hills to the North. But in itself, it has a unique and interesting history and geology.

In amongst the hills - the high point of Beacon Batch at 325 m above sea level, the striking Crook Peak - lies historic and interesting geology. Gorges dominate the south end of the hills; Cheddar is both the deepest and longest in hte UK. Wookey Hole is built around a system of carboniferous limestone caves. And in amongst all of this, ancient forest, heathland, and nature reserves for the protected native species.

It's not just natural features either - man-made features driven by lead mining and cheese production bring context and a human side to the spectacular landscape.

350 million years ago, the land lay beneath a tropical sea. This led to the formation of some of the most stunning and dramatic of natural landscapes, eventually exposed to the air and allowed to thrive as a natural habitat.

The market towns that nestle in the shadow of these hills possess a charm that larger tourist destinations often lack. Wells, with its magnificent medieval cathedral and moated Bishop's Palace, serves as the eastern gateway to the Mendips. To the west, the ancient borough of Axbridge guards the passage to the coast, its timber-framed buildings speaking to centuries of prosperous trade. Between them is Cheddar, a busy and modern town with ancient history on its doorstep. Nearby Glastonbury is known all over the world for the music at Worthy Farm, but the lesser known Glastonbury Tor can be seen for further than the music can be heard.


While small, the Mendips are a concentrated set of environments and habitats. That makes it possible to go from pastures and farmland into stunning limestone gorges, back into forest and then through a tiny residentail hamlet all in the same walk. Ancient drove roads cross the plateau, once used to move livestock to market, now serving as footpaths for ramblers seeking solitude. And, if you pick the right location, you can do it all from the front door.
